Effeciency Analysis
-------------------

printTissue:
------------

Input Size - n (row/col of the tissue array)

operation(s) - print

best case - n^2 (# of rows * # of cols)

worst case - n^2 (# of rows * # of cols)

big O(n^2)

assignCellTypes:
----------------

Input size - n (row/col of the tissue array)

operation(s) - assign character to tissue array

base case - n^2 (# of rows * # of cols)

worst case - n^2 (# of rows * # of cols)

big O(n^2)

isSatisfied:
------------

Input Size - n (row/col of the tissue array)

operation(s) - compare the values surrounding the cell to the cell

best case - 6 (if the smallest array is inputted (2x2) then only two comparisons must be made per cell and one of the spaces must be a blank)

worst case - 8((n*n) - ((4n-8) + 8)) + 5(4n-8) + 12 = 8n^2 - 32n - 32 (this accounts for corner cases, side cases, and regular cases)

big O(n^2) 

boardSatisfied:
---------------

input size - n (row/col of the tissue array)

operation(s) - call isSatisfied (whose bigO is n^2)

best case - n^2 (only calls isSatisfied once and it returns false)

worst case - n^4 (calls isSatisfied n^2 times)

big O(n^4)

moveAllUnsatisfied:
-------------------

input size - n (row/col of the tissue array)

operation(s) - call isSatisfied (n^2 times) and swap char values in tissue array

best case - n^4(calling isSatisfied n^2 times) + 1(only one cell is unsatisfied)

worst case - n^4 + (n^2-1)(all cells are unsatisfied and there is at least one space)

big O(n^4) (I ingore lower order terms)

endSimulation:
--------------

input size - n (row/col of the tissue array)

operation(s) - incrementing int numMoved, call printTissue twice, and print statements

best case - 3n^2 + 7

worst case - 3n^2 + 7 (same as best case because the method always does the same thing)

big O(n^2) 

main:
-----

input size - n (row/col of the tissue array)

operation(s) - call assignCellType, make copy of tissue array, call boardSatisfied, call endSimulation, call printTissue, call moveUnsatisfied

best case - n^4 + 3n^2 (The board is satisfied as soon as its cell types are assigned)

worst case - n^4 + 3n^2 + maxRounds*(n^4 + n^2)

big O(maxRounds*n^4) (I did not disregard the coeffecient because it is not a constant)
