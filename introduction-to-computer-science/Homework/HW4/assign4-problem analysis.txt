Problem 1 (Gradebook)
------------------
Analysis:
For the computeGrade method, I made a for loop that would check each grade index for the particular student and if there was something
other than -1, meaning they weren't excused, it would add 1 to a counter and calculate the grade for that test and it it to variable sum.
If the counter equals 0 after the whole loop, I print "the student has been excused for all tests". If not, I divide the grades by the counter 
and return that value.

For the computeAllGrades method, I used my computeGrade method to get the grade for each student and I put those values into an array and
returned that array.

For the computeClassAverage method, I used a for loop to check for each student if they were excused form the exam. Of not, one would be
aded to a counter and that score would be added to sum. After that, I return that sum divided by the counter.




Problem 2 (Matrix)
----------------------
Analysis:
For this problem, first I initialized the control variable i, j, k, and a. 

i = row of matrix1 and product matrix. Also the equals the column of matrix2.
j = column of matrix1 and row of matrix2.
k = used so I know when I am finished multiplying one row by one column,
a = column of product matrix.

Then I made a for loop which would take the index at i,j
in the first matrix and j,i in the second matrix and multiply. Doing so lets me move horizontally in one matrix and vertically in the other. Then
I used varible k to control gettting the sum of one row multiplied by a column. I would put that sum in index i,a in the product matrix. I use
i because the first matrix and the product matrix are always in the same row in my program. However, I used a for my product matrix so that after one iteration
of getting the sum of a column multiplied by a row, I move only one space over in my product matrix.
