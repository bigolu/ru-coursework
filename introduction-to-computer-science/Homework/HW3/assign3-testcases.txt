Problem 1 (Taxes)
------------------
Analysis:
For this problem, I made a muliple formulas for calculating tax based on which interval
the user's income lies in. The intervals are based on where the percentage of tax is
changes.


Test Case 1
Input:
9000
Expected Output:
950
Actual Output:
950

Test Case 2
Input:
60000
Expected Output:
11200
Actual Output:
11200

Test Case 3
Input:
100000
Expected Output:
23000
Actual Output:
23000

Test Case 4
Input:
-1
Expected Output:
User entered bad input.
Actual Output:
User entered bad input.

Problem 2 (TwoSmallest)
----------------------
Analysis:
For this problem, my main concerns where ensuring that two values would be compared and
put into the variables lowest and secondlowest accordingly because for the first
two numbers, they cannot be compared to anything but themselves. To fix this,
 I added a count to my for loop so that after ther first two numbers, it would
compare the rest to the lowest and secondlowest values. Also, I made sure that
when the lowest value is replaced, the its former value is stored in
secondlowest.

Test Case 1
Inputs:
-1,1,3,0,-5,-4,-5,-1
Expected Output:
-5
-5
Actual Output:
-5
-5


Test Case 2
Inputs:
-1,1,3,6,0,1,-6,-1
Expected Output:
-6
0
Actual Output:
-6
0

Test Case 3
Inputs:
-1,-1
Expected Output:
User entered bad input.
(You must give at least two values to have a lowest and second lowest value)
Actual Output:
User entered bad input.
(You must give at least two values to have a lowest and second lowest value)

Test Case 3
Inputs:
-1,5,-1
Expected Output:
User entered bad input.
(You must give at least two values to have a lowest and second lowest value)
Actual Output:
User entered bad input.
(You must give at least two values to have a lowest and second lowest value)

Problem 3 (NthPrime)
----------------------
Analysis: For this problem, I knew I would need a nested loop because the inner 
loop would keep checking if there are factors other than one and itself and the 
outer loop would generate the numbers that were being tested for being magical numbers.

Test Case 1
Input:
0
Expected Output:
User entered bad input.
Actual Output:
User entered bad input.

Test Case 2
Input:
11
Expected Output:
31
Actual Output:
31

Test Case 3
Input:
1
Expected Output:
2
Actual Output:
2
